## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The collection found here contains materials from Psychiana, which was a mail-order religion that operated between 1928 to 1952. Key elements of this religion included the belief that each person contains the spirit of "God-power" and could harness that power for success. It was a fast-growing religion founded by Frank Bruce Robinson. 

Example materials that can be found in this collection are:
